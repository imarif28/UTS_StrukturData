# Car Dealership Management System

## Project Description

This project is a car dealership management system developed in Java. It handles inventory management, sales tracking, and data organization for car brands such as Toyota, Honda, and Suzuki. The system leverages various Java classes for modular design and implements key data structures for efficient operation.

## Features

- **Inventory Management:** Track stock for Toyota, Honda, and Suzuki cars.
- **Sales Tracking:** Record and manage sold cars for each brand.
- **User Interaction:** Provides a menu-driven interface for managing inventory and sales.
- **Data Structures:** Uses linked lists for efficient data storage and manipulation.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Libraries:** 
  - `Scanner` for user input.
  - `LinkedList` for managing dynamic data structures.

## How the Program Works

1. **Initialization:** 
   - The program initializes stock and sales lists for each car brand.
   - Provides a menu for user interaction.

2. **Core Functionalities:**
   - Add cars to stock.
   - Record car sales and update inventory.
   - Display available stock and sold cars.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Validates user input to prevent incorrect operations.

## Code Structure

- **`Main.java`:** The main entry point of the program that integrates all functionalities and manages user interactions.
- **`Function.java`:** Contains core methods for processing operations like adding, removing, or displaying data.
- **`List.java`:** Implements the list structure to manage stock and sales.
- **`Elemen.java`:** Represents individual elements (e.g., cars) within the list.
- **`Mobil.java`:** Defines the car object with attributes like name, type, color, and license plate.
- **`data_mobil.java`:** Stores and manages car data, potentially linking with the list for inventory and sales.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Setup:**
   - Compile all `.java` files using a Java compiler.
   - Run the `Main` class to start the application.

2. **Usage Instructions:**
   - Follow the menu prompts to manage car stock and sales.
   - Input car details when prompted (e.g., name, type, color, license plate).
